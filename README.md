My Forecast

Democrats will win the House but not the Senate.
There will be record high voter turnout, especially from 18-25 year olds.

Arizona
Sinema will beat McSally
Doug Ducey will beat Garcia.
  Clear blue wave in Arizona politics
  large voter turnout for 18-25 

Texas
Ted Cruz will beat O'Rourke
  Close margins 
  large support base for O'Rourke, he will become a clear figure for the Democratic party in 2020 (Vice President?)

Florida
Nelson will beat Scott
